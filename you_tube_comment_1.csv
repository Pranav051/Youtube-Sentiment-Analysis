7 earbuds? You know the reason ️..Thala for a Reason 7️⃣
"I asked you about the realme t300 on Instagram reel and here you included it in the video, that made me happy."
You have such a great sense of style
I like this new hairstyle 
"Nirvana Ion is pretty good, but need some tweaking first. 
1. I had to change the ear tips for a better fit and comfort, took the oval shaped ear tip from oppo enco 32. 
2. Always make sure that you are using AAC codec, and signature sound mode for a better audio experience. 
3. Definitely try to use the equalizer, i liked it better when i increased the treble frequency a bit."
Please add  video for best earbuds under Rs 10000  and Rs 5000 from this festival season offers.

Please include other factors while reviewing like app support and how good the app is and connection quality/strength etc. I have nord buds 2 but connectivity with more than 2 devices is a headache. Wish someone pointed that out before I bought them.
Excellent

It's true medam realme T300 .super for 2000 rupees
acer predator helios neo 16 i9 14th gen rtx 4060 nepali price
Does realme t 300 has duel device connectivity
Boat nirvana ion have the worst sound quality in that price bracket. Though they have good battery. But sound quality is very cheap
I can recommend absolutely no one to buy the T300. Mine stopped working after only 30 days lol. Waste of money. Get the Nords buds 3 instead.
